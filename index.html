<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This repository is at its very early stage and under heavy development, do <em>NOT</em> use at the moment!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Only Python 3 (&gt;= 3.4) is supported!</p>
<p>This package provides the tools to simulate the <em>realistic</em> low-frequency radio foregrounds, which can be further used to test various foreground removal or separation methods, for the purpose of successfully detecting the 21cm cosmological signal arising from the netrual hydrogen (HI) of epoch of reionization (EoR).</p>
