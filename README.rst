Realistic Foregrounds Simulation for EoR 21cm Signal Detection
==============================================================

**WARNING:**
This repository is at its very early stage and under heavy development,
do *NOT* use at the moment!

This repository provides the tools to simulate the currently *most realistic*
(to our knowledge) low-frequency radio foregrounds, which can be further
used to test various foreground removal or separation methods, for the
purpose of successfully detecting the 21cm cosmological signal arising
from the netrual hydrogen (HI) of epoch of reionization (EoR).
